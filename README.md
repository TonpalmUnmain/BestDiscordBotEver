# ü§ñ BestBotEver!!! 3.0.0 Documentation

---

## Overview
This bot is a **Discord moderation and utility assistant** with customizable features, logging, 
and command-line control. It uses the **discord.py** library with extended command functionality.  
The bot handles moderation (timeouts, banned words, forgiveness), system monitoring, log retrieval, 
and utility commands. It can also be controlled from both Discord and a console interface.

---

## Key Features
- Automatic banning of predefined offensive words.
- Logs all messages with timestamps to daily log files.
- Timeout functionality for users using banned words.
- Owner and admin-only commands for moderation.
- Utility commands for server interaction (repeat, version, etc.).
- Detailed session/system info reporting (CPU, GPU, Memory, Disk, Network).
- Custom console interface for starting, stopping, and managing the bot.
- Supports dynamic message placeholders `<{mention:ID}>`, `<{channel:ID}>`, `<{role:ID}>`.

---

## Configuration
The bot reads its configuration from **config.json**, which must include:

- `token`: The bot token for authentication.  
- `default_target_channel_id`: The channel ID for startup/shutdown messages.  
- `version`: Version string of the bot.  
- `author`: Author/maintainer of the bot.  
- `command_prefix`: Prefix for bot commands.  
- `admin_role_id`: Role ID required for some privileged commands.  

---

## Moderation System
The bot maintains a **banned_words.json** file storing blocked terms.  
If a user types or edits a message containing one, the bot will:
- Delete the message.  
- Timeout the user for 5 minutes.  
- Notify the channel.  

Admins can dynamically add/remove banned words with commands.
